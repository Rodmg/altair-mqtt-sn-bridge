	Memory structure:
		DBHeader
		Entry
		Entry
		...
		Entry

	DBHeader structure:
		signature0	->	'm'
		signature1	->	'a'
		signature2	->	'k'
		entrySize	->	sizeof(Entry)
		nEntries	->	<number of current active entries>
		indexSectors[0]
		indezSectors[1]	->  Each bit of this indexes represents one entry
		...					on memory, 1 active, 0 free.
		indexSectors[11]	Example: bit 0 of indezSectors[0] is the first entry
							(entry 0) after the Header.
							Bit 2 of indezSectors[2] is the entry number 18.

	How it works:
		At init, checks if signature and entrySize are correct, if not,
		an empty new header is written. (this could happen when the device is new,
		the memory gets corrupted or a change in this code is made.)
