 *	Hal Persist, filesystem-like EEPROM abstraction.
 *	Current implementation uses uint16_t indexes, for a theoretical max of 64 KB.
 *	Allocates part of the EEPROM for application, currently cannot deallocate previously allocated space.
 *	Warning: keep in mind that allocations should be done in the same order every time the device is started,
 *	If this order is altered or something changes in development, you should erase the whole EEPROM after programming,
 *	else you can get wrong data readings.
